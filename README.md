# lxpanel-plugin-example
This is a minimum example for writing lxpanel plugins based on the lxde wiki

read this: https://wiki.lxde.org/en/How_to_write_plugins_for_LXPanel

I couldn't find a good barebones minimal plugin for lxpanel (the panel of lxde). 
The code comes from the instruction page of the lxde wiki. This repo could be used as a minimal skeleton for writing future plugins.

I combined the code small code snippets to a file and added a simple minimal makefile:

edit the source and

run

```
make
make install
make run 
```


or do theses steps by hand or include them to your build system, however you feel about it. 
After compiling and placing the freshly created plugin binary and restarting the panel(done by make) add it by hand to your running lxpanel instance.

Have a nice day!
