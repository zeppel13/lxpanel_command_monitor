# lxpanel_command_monitor

edit code and

```
make run && lxpanel
```

This lxpanel plugin queries playerctl every second and displays the current artist and title. In the future, I'd like to define custom commands and run them periodically. I'm sad because I couldn't interact properly with lxpanel's configuration management.
